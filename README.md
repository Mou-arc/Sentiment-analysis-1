Sentiment analysis on IMBD reviews. The dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle. It is a medium-sized dataset, containing 50k records equally balanced with 25 positive and 25 negatives reviews. The dataset has two variables - one is 'review' and the other is 'sentiment.' The analysis (CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS) aims to predict what will be the customer's reaction in the movie-world on IMBD based on the the past customer's response. The reviews are not on a single show but on the entire shows of the IMBD.
The analysis is carried on by building LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, and by keeping in mind to perform EDA and diagnostic analytics.
The outcome of building the LSTM model to check the sentiment percentage for future is not reliable and needs to be improved for better prediction.
